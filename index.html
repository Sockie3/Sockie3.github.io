                        <p>The primary objective of Lab 1 is to serve as an introduction to the Artemis Nano board and
                            the Arduino IDE. The Artemis Nano is a development board created by Sparkfun Electronics to
                            use in small-scale projects. In ECE 4160, Artemis is programmed using Python and the Arduino
                            IDE. The lab involves installing the Arduino software and learning how to set up and use the
                            Artemis board by running a handful of example programs on it.</p>

                        <b>The Prelab.</b>
                        <p>The first step of the process was to complete the prelab, which involved installing the
                            Arduino IDE onto the computer being used for the lab. When you go to the Downloads page on
                            the Arduino website, there are several versions of the software available for different
                            operating systems. I used macOS with an Intel processor, so that is the version that I
                            installed.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_1/Downloads.jpeg" alt="Downloads" style="width:912px;height:400px;">
                        <div class="flex-grow-1"></div>
                        <b>The Lab Tasks.</b>
                        <p>Once the software was downloaded, it was time to set everything up according to the
                            instructions referenced under “Resources” in the Introduction. First, I connected the
                            Artemis board to my computer using a USB-C. Next, I opened the IDE and installed the
                            SparkFun Apollo3 package. This package contains source files, libraries, and other tools
                            that would allow me to use the Arduino software with Artemis. Once that was done, I could
                            select the Artemis Nano board from the newly available board options.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_1/Selected.jpeg" alt="Selected" style="width:850px;height:400px;">
                        <p>Now that everything was set up, it was time to gain familiarity with the Artemis board by
                            testing out a few example programs available on the IDE as well as some Artemis-specific
                            examples from the SparkFun package. The examples that were used for this lab were “Blink it
                            Up” from the IDE and “Example2_Serial”, “Example4-analogRead”, and
                            “Example1_MicrophoneOutput” from the package. For all the examples, I had to first manually
                            select the board, then press the “Verify” and “Upload” buttons on the top left corner of the
                            pop-up window.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_1/Choose.png" alt="Choose" style="width:615px;height:400px;">
                        <p>In the “Blink it Up” example, one of the LEDs on the board would blink every second. In the
                            code there is a loop, so the blinking doesn’t stop unless we stop the program. Below is an
                            image of the loop as well as a video of the blinking light.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_1/Exampleone.png" alt="Exampleone" style="width:615px;height:400px;">
                        <!--<video src="assets/img/Exvidone.png" alt="Exvidone" style="width:615px;height:400px;">-->
                        <p>In the “Example2_Serial” example, I was able to “talk” to the board by typing in messages in
                            the serial monitor and the Artemis would “answer” me by repeating what I wrote back to me.
                            Our “conversation” is shown below.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_1/Exampletwo.png" alt="Exampletwo" style="width:615px;height:400px;">
                        <p>In the “Example4-analogRead” example, the serial monitor continuously outputs the temperature
                            read (raw ADC) from the sensor. I could change the temperature by first rubbing (warming)
                            the board and then blowing (cooling) it. The temperature reads from these two actions are
                            shown below in the same order.</p>

                        <p>In the “Example1_MicrophoneOutput” the serial monitor continuously outputs the frequency
                            detected by the microphone. Below is a video showing how the frequency read changes as I hum
                            with various pitches.</p>

                            Artemis Nano board and the Arduino IDE. This experience provides a smooth transition into
                            more complex projects because it ensures that the board works properly for simple tasks.
                            Moreover, it demonstrated some capabilities of the Artemis board that could be applied to
                            future Labs in ECE 4160.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of Lab 2 is to enable communication between the Artemis board and the computer
                            using Bluetooth, which was done so that in future labs Bluetooth can be used to send data.
                            The lab involved establishing the connection and then testing it by trying out several
                            different processing commands on the Artemis board.</p>

                        <b>The PRELAB.</b>
                        <p>The first step of the process was to complete the prelab, which consisted of several parts.
                            The first part involved installing Python 3, a virtual environment, and several python
                            packages. Next I downloaded the codebase, set it up, and organized the directory. After
                            this, I started the Jupyter server. Lastly, I installed ArduinoBLE using the library manager
                            in the Arduino IDE.</p>
                        <p>Before moving forward, it’s important to understand what Bluetooth is, what’s included in the
                            provided codebase, and how both of them work.</p>
                        <b>Bluetooth.</b>
                        <p>Bluetooth is a method of wireless communication where any device can obtain information from
                            available data. As described in the ArtemisBLE reference in the Introduction, there’s a
                            peripheral device that behaves similarly to a bulletin board: it contains all the data and
                            any device in the system can read it.</p>
                        <b>Codebase.</b>
                        <p>The codebase splits the lab into two main parts. First, we have the code in the Arduino IDE
                            (located in the ble_arduino folder), which is what gets run on the Artemis board. Second, we
                            have the Python code in the Jupyter Notebook (located in the ble_python folder). This is
                            where we run our commands including establishing the Bluetooth connection and running
                            example commands. Both folders have files that allow the two parts to work together. It’s
                            very important that both halves of the codebase are consistent with each other, otherwise
                            communication will fail.</p>
                        <p>At this point we could determine our board’s MAC address by running the ble_arduino.ino
                            sketch located in the ble_arduino folder in our codebase. The output of the program with the
                            board’s MAC address is shown here:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_2/mac_address.jpeg" alt="mac_address"
                            style="width:640px;height:400px;">
                        <div class="flex-grow-1"></div>
                        <b>THE LAB TASKS.</b>
                        <p>The first task was to change some configurations in the codebase. First, I copied the MAC
                            address obtained in the prelab and pasted it in the connection.yaml file in Jupyter. Next, I
                            changed out BLEService UUID so that my computer connected to the correct Artemis board. I
                            put this new UUID address in the connection.yaml file and the ble_arduino.ino sketch.</p>
                        <p>I obtained the new UUID by creating a new cell in my Jupyter notebook and running the
                            commands as illustrated below:</p>

                        <p>Next, I ensured that the addresses and the command types agree between conneciton.yaml and
                            ble_arduino. Below are images of the updated connection.yaml and ble_arduino.ino files, in

                        <p>After changing the configurations, I ensured that the Bluetooth connection works properly by
                            running the demo.ipynb file in Jupyter. The two screenshots below demonstrate that I was
                            able to connect the two devices:</p>

                            a screenshot of the "PING" and "SET_TWO_INTS" commands on Jupyter. Second, we have the
                            output of these commands in the arduino software. Both commands were executed successfully.

                        <b>Task 1.</b>
                        <p>The “Send Echo Command” takes as an input some message from the user and then prints it back
                            out, just like a real echo! To implement it in the ble_arduino.ino sketch, I copied and
                            pasted the code from the “Ping” command and changed two lines. Then, I wrote two commands in
                            the Jupyter file using the “Ping” command as an example:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_2/task_1.png" alt="task_1" style="width:869px;height:400px;">
                        <p>The next three commands are new, so for all of them I first had to add the name of each
                            command to CommandTypes in the ble_arduino.ino sketch and to the CMD class in cmd_types.py,
                            as shown:
                        </p>

                        <b>Task 2.</b>
                        <p>The “Get Time Command” outputs the long “currentMillis” in the following format:
                            “T:(currentMillis)”. To implement it in the ble_arduino.ino sketch, I modified the code from
                            the “Ping'' command. Next, I wrote the new command in Jupyter:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_2/task_2.png" alt="task_2" style="width:903px;height:300px;">
                        <div class="flex-grow-1"></div>
                        <b>Task 3.</b>
                        <p>The “Notification Handler” allows updated data from the Artemis board to be continuously
                            printed out, which is very useful for the next two commands. To write the code, I took
                            inspiration from my classmates:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_2/task_3.png" alt="task_3" style="width:876px;height:300px;">

                        <b>Task 4.</b>
                        <p>The “GET_TEMP_5s” sends the internal die temperature readings for different time stamps in
                            the following format “T:(time)|C:(temperature)|...”. Measurements are taken once per second
                            for five seconds. To implement this, I created a loop that repeats 5 times and has a delay
                            of 1 second after every round to ensure that measurements are taken once per second:</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/lab_2/task_4.png" alt="task_4" style="width:615px;height:400px;">

                        <b>Task 5.</b>
                        <p>The “GET_TEMP_5s_RAPID” is almost like “GET_TEMP_5s”, except in this case we take as many
                            samples as possible over 5 seconds. Thus, to implement this I had to modify the
                            “GET_TEMP_5s” code to have a while loop that repeats until the current time is 5 seconds and
                            that doesn’t have a delay:</p>

                            once I implemented and ran all the examples described above.</p>

                        <p>It’s important to note that there is a limitation when it comes to Bluetooth communication.
                            Let’s take 5 seconds of 16-bit values taken at 150 Hz as an example. In total, we would
                            have:
                        </p>
                        <p>(5 seconds)*(150 times/second)*(16 bits)*(1 byte/8 bits) = 1500 bytes of data every 5
                            seconds.</p>
                        <p>We’re given that the Artemis board has 384000 bytes of RAM. This means that the maximum
                            number of 5-second cycles that we can have is the following:</p>
                        <p>(384000 bytes)/(1500 bytes) = 256</p>
                        <p>So the Artemis board can’t handle more than 256 rounds of such 5-second cycles.</p>

                        <p>The importance of Lab 2 was to enable a wireless method of communication between the computer
                            and the Artemis board. To do this, we used Bluetooth BLE, a wireless communication system
                            that allows data transfer between two devices. As a result, we now have a convenient way to
                            exchange information between robots to use in future labs.

                                <p>In Lab 3, we used a varied number of sensors to allow our robot to gather
                                    information
                                    from its surroundings. This is a very important milestone because giving
                                    a robot some
                                    way to perceive the environment is the first step for it to be able to
                                    interact with the
                                    outside world. Moreover, this step gives us an opportunity to explore a
                                    variety of new
                                    and interesting projects moving forward!
